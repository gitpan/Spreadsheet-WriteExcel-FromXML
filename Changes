	* Added parameter for large spreadsheets (>7Mb), this allows
	  FromXML to work with versions of OLE::Storage_Lite that do not
	  yet support IO::Scalar output.  This also means that until 
	  OLE::Storage_Lite is patched, FromXML will only support the 
	  production of 'smaller' XLS files.
        * Added data type functionality to rows & cells.
	  The following types are now supported:
	    - string
	    - number
	    - url
	    - formula
	    - blank
	  An invalid type will default to write_string.
	  Not defining a type will default to write_string.
        * Updated DTD
